 1. Write a short reflection (200-300 words) on what you found most interesting about this religion and why you got interested in watching and writing about it.                                                                                                                                    The most interesting aspect of Buddhism I've learned from watching the video is the emphasis on inner peace and the interconnectedness of all things. Just from a glance of our society you can realize the lack of patience and restlessness that some people convey shows that they haven't really applied themselves to emotional control. I truly believe that society can really benefit from the prioritization of inner peace. To sit down and think that just planting a tree can contribute to improving your own being because of the interconnectedness of life resonates deeply. It highlights the responsibility individuals have towards the environment and each other. The concept of achieving calmness and serenity through practices like meditation and yoga is something that not enough light is being shed on In a world that often feels chaotic and stressful. But i can admit that the promise of finding inner peace through dedicated practice is compelling. Even learning about the rituals for example the Hungry Ghosts ritual and the scattering of rice and blessed money, gives us a sweet glimpse into how Buddhists express these values and culture in their daily lives. These practices highlight the significance of compassion, connection to the spiritual realm, and the cyclical nature of life and death in Buddhist thought.
 2. 2. Reflect on **how learning about different religions** contributes to tolerance and understanding? ( 100 words)     Learning about different religions  can contribute to tolerance and understanding in many ways. These different ways can include the avoidance of unintentional ignorance towards other religions, and with a better understanding of someone else's life style creates a general respect between different religions.  As someone who believes in Catholicism It part of  the culture to respect other people beliefs and to pray for others that they may one day find God, but never to force my religion onto someone else. Having this respect for other peoples belief can create tolerance which in mass amounts creates a closer society having practiced these good habits
 3. What is the pilgrimage of this religion( where do people visit) use atleast 2-3 references. Attach 2 pics with captions.( 75 words)                                                                    There are four main sites that Buddhists visit which is the Lumbini which is the birth place of Buddha. The Bodh Gaya which is where the Buddha attained his enlightenment. The Sarnath is the location of Buddhas first sermon. Finally the Kushinagar which is the location that Buddha attained Parinirvana. These four aren't the only holy Buddhist sites however. There are four more holy sites known as Sravasti, Sankasya, Vaisali, and Rajgir but they arent known as the primary ones but they still are of great importance in the Buddhist culture.
