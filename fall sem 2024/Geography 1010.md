1. What have Hmong's gone through when they were moved to a new country? (Answer in about 100 words
Around 10:00 we speak to the daughter of an immigrant from Hmoung he had to prioritize his work over  going to school in order to provide for his family financially, while the mother was able to go to school all the while she is struggling to raise the her kids. Timestamp 22:25 theres is a different woman who speaks about her struggle from her and husband both getting laid off from their jobs, and received zero support for social services. She now has to work a job that pays only 5.75 hourly. That job has to cover her 6 kids, rent, and food. This stress has taken a toll on her mental health, even so much as het claiming to want to hang herself.

2. What were the difficulties they faced trying to follow their culture and traditions in a new country where there is a language barrier and limited employment opportunities?
Hmoung believe the only was to live is through speaking the native language which is hindered by the fact that they are now residents of the US and now have to conform when around others. In the 19:26 time stamp the woman talks about how the men are more appreciated than the women in the hmoung culture.
3. Do you feel the title of the video is appropriate " Being Hmong Means Being Free" if yes or no? Why and explain (in 100 words) 
No I do no believe hmong means being free is appropriate because its just a reminder on how they Hmoung people were forcefully relocated to losing the Vietnam war. This relocation of families has cause a toll on their culture because the people of Hmoung face the struggles of poverty while raising family that usually has lots of  kids. This is a huge factor on the mental health of the parents trying their best to be providers to their kids againts such opposition. The loss of culture through generation as times goes forward is gonna be another struggle as the future grand daughters wont have a need to use needle work to pass on stories 

4. What 5 thoughts/ideas came to your mind while watching this video. List and briefly discuss. ( 50-100 words)



Around the time stamp 3:29 she mentioned that she had around 14 siblings like it was a common a occurrence where she is from.


While watching this video, it had occurred to me that there was villagers recruited by The CIA to fight Communists which i find interesting.

I think its cool how the Hmoung people have a yearly festival that preserves their culture and creates a fun social gathering 

I wonder what the reason is for Houmng singles to only find courtships during the Hmoung yearly festival.

Flower cloth is done by needle work, is used for decoration, and is the only way to pass on stories throughout generation in the Hmoung
