Sampling Distribution,

The Probalilty Distribution of a sample (random) statistic is called sampling distribution.

A sampling distribution of all the possible values of a sample statistic for a given sample size selected from a population.

### Inferential Statistics
* The use of quantitative techniques to Generalize from a from a sample to a population
* Inference really has two parts: 
1. Estimate
2. Say how good our estimate is ( test hypothesis)
- Main idea is simple: take a small subset of the population ( a sample) and use that subset to infer what the whole population looks like

 Generalizability 
The ability to project the results of one study to a much larger reality.

Sampling
* Random(probability) samples are more generalizable
* Voluntary or convenience samples are less generalizable
* To ensure that this representation is a good one, we employ RANDOMIZATION
* Before we can randomize, we need a sampling frame, a list of all the subjects in a population

 Sampling Distribution 
The probability distribution of a sample (random) system is called sampling distribution.

Probability Distributions
Definition: The probability distribution of a discrete random variable lists all the possible values that the random variable can assume and their corresponding probabilities.

Sampling Distribution 
The probability  of a sample distribution of a sample (random)
statistic is called sampling distribution.

* Suppose there are only five students in an advanced statistics class and the midterm scores of these five students  are 
			70, 78, 80, 80, 95
*Consider all possible samples of three scores each that can be selected from that population. 
* how many are there? \
* Suppose we assign the letter A, B, C, D, E to the scores of the five students so that
* A=70, B=78, C=80, D=80, E=95

* Then the 10 possible samples of three scores each are
* abc, abd, abe, acd, acem ade, bcd bce, bdem cde*


### Central Limit Theorem

* CLT: for random sampling, as the sample grows, the sampling distribution approaches a normal distribution
* Even if the population is not normal,
* ...sample means from population will be approximately normal as long as the sample size is large enough.
* Take that in for a second.... it's pretty remarkable
###### The CLT applies to population distributions that are: 
* Highly skewed Very irregular 
* U-shaped
* Highly discrete
* Whatever

What is a Hypothesis? 
- A hypothesis is a testable Statement about some characteristic of a variable or collection of variable or collection of variables 
- Much of the interesting stuff you can do with statistics is related to the creation and testing or hypothesis

## Null vs. Alternative Hypothesis

For the purpose of testing \hypothesis that is directly tested 
1. A Null Hypothesis: (H$_0$) that is directly tested
		 Usually a statement of no effect
  2. An alternative hypothesis: (H$_a$) a contradiction to the null hypothesis.


* Null ($H_0$) : There is no difference in the population between boys and girlsin reading ability 
* Alternative (H$_a$): There is a difference in the between boys and girls in reading ability

* Null ($H_0$): There is no relationship in the population between education and earnings.
* Alternative ($H_a$) : There is relationship in the population between education and earnings.
* Null ($H_0$): There is no significant change in my health during the times when I drink green tea only or root beer only.

## Null vs Alternative Hypothesis 

Level of significance = 0.05

### P-Value 
This represents the probability of observing the sample estimate when the null hypothesis about the population is true

is it significant - it is a statistically significant
We reject the null hypothesis if the p value is below the cut-off value ( commonly we use significane level .05) And... we accept the alternative hypothesis.

### Two sample Tests

Independant T-test = Unpaired T-Test

Dependent T test = Paired T-Test

Analysis of Variance (Anova)

### T-test
1. Test between the means of Different/Unrelated Groups (unpaired)
		- Null (H$_0$): There is no difference between boys and girls in reading ability H$_0$ : μ1 = μ2 (No difference)
		- Alternative (H$_a$): There is no difference between boys and girl in reading ability H$_1$ : μ1 ≠ μ2 (Difference)
2. Test between the means of related Groups (paired)
		- Null (H0): There is no difference in the pre and post test of this class
H0: μ𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 = μ𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 (No Difference)

Chi-Square Test
	- To test two categorical variables are related - cross tabulation
	- Cross tabulation is a two way table

Simple Linear Regression Model
	- only one 
Simple regression 
	- Best-fit straight 
	- How the independant variable (x) predicts the dependent variable (Y)
	- Y= $b_0$ + b$_1$ x
